"""Adopt a Claude Code session into the wheelhouse, by handoff.

The wheelhouse lists recent transcripts from ~/.claude/projects, plus sessions it already
tracks whose process has gone (e.g. an adoption whose tab failed). If the chosen session is
still running, the person types /exit in its tab first; the wheelhouse never kills it. Then
the wheelhouse registers the session under its own id and opens it in a new tab like any
restore: `claude --resume <id>` with the wheelhouse's MCP server, monitor, protocol and
/wheelhouse commands.
